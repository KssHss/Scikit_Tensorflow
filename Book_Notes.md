# Fundamentals:
examples that the system uses to learn --> trianing set  
each training example --> training instance or sample  
Spam filter: Performance measured as the ratio of correctly classified emails --> accuracy (used in classification tasks)

## Types of ML: 
* Whether or not they are trained with human supervision (supervised, unsuper‐ vised, semisupervised, and Reinforcement Learning) 
* Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly (online versus batch learning) 
*  Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points, or instead detect patterns in the training data and build a predictive model, much like scientists do (instance-based versus model-based learning) 

Can be combined: a state-of-the-art spam filter may learn on the fly using a deep neural network model trained using examples of spam and ham; this makes it an online, model- based, supervised learning system.

### Supervised: 
training data includes labels (desired solutions) or predictors.
* Typical tasks: classification, predict a target numeric value (regression)
Attribute is data type # feature ~ attribute + value (can be used interchangeably)

Most important algorithms: 
• k-Nearest Neighbors
• Linear Regression
• Logistic Regression (commonly used for classification: it can output the probability of belonging to a given class)
• Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
• Decision Trees and Random Forests
• Neural networks (can be unsupervised or semi)  

### Unsupervised:
